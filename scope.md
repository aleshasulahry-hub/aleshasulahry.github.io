# Project Scope Statement- Aleshas Personal Intro Webpage

## Project Name
Aleshas Introduction Webpage

## Project Purpose

I have made this webpage to have the viewer grasp a genuine understanding of who I am and what my aspirations are. I benefit from this webpage by practicing scoping as well as semantic HTML!

## Description

This project will be an HTML only document using semantic HTML. This project is a personal introduction webpage. I will have everything organized in the following way: 

* A title
* A main heading that has my name
* A subheading which states my major or professoinal interests
* Two or more paragraphs which go into detail about my goals for the course or my career
* An unordered list with at least three list items which detail my hobbies and interests
* A hyperlink that takes to directly my GitHub

## Desired Results 

The outcome that I am targetting is the following:

* Zero errors
* An HTML file that reads clearly and is to the point
* All elements are shown
* Well- structured, and all semantic tags are used correctly in the proper place
* Matches to what is written on the rubric under "Exemplary" 

## Exclusions 

I am only focusing on the HTML- only requirement. Everything else is out of scope. Exclusions include:

* Any extra unnecessary information about myself such as where I am from, my favorite food, etc.
* No other advanced features
* No images, audios, or video files
* No sensitive or private personal data
* No multi- page website, just a single HTML file

## Prioirites

This HTML webpage needs to exceed my expectations and imgination. To get to this point, my priorities are:

* Quality: The webpage must match to everything I wrote in the description. I need to make sure I use correct semantic HTML. I need to make sure my webpage is free of all minor/major errors
* Time: The webpage needs to be completed before August 31st, 11:59 PM
* Budget: NO budget since I am using Visual Code and my personal laptop
* Focus most on quality, but also pay attention to clean structure and design

## Acceptance Criteria

The file includes:

* Title, main heading, subheading, at least two paragraphs, an unordered list with three pr mpre items, and a hyperlink to GitHub
* Both files are present in the main project folder (aleshas personal webpage project)
* The HTML is valid and opens correctly in a browser
* The project is turned in before the due date
* Instructor reviews assignment and agrees that requirements are met
