        <h2>Student of Computing Applications at Texas Tech University</h2>
    <p>I am excited for this course because it is the first time I am putting myself into the world of tech. I feel like this class specifically is helping me truly understand the basics so that later on I always have a foundation to work with in future projects. Through this course I want to learn more about web development and programming languages. I want to be more confident with using Visual Code, Obsidian, and GitHub. I want to have a better understanding of HTML, Markdown, semantic elements, etc. Another focus that I want to master is project management. Being able to truly be in control and be successful in projects, as well as bridging them to the technical field, will really help me in my future career.</p>

<p>As someone who has always jumped from one interest to the next, I am trying to start afresh with my approach to learning and personal development. I want to focus on building a strong foundation in the tech skills that will be most beneficial for my career. Doing more and more research, I am slowly looking at fields such as software support or front-end web development. I want to use my skills of communication, fast learning, and attention to detail to my advantage. I am excited to see where this journey takes me and what I can accomplish with the right mindset and dedication.</p>
