# All About Alesha Sulahry
This website is to really go into depth about who I am! I am someone who's always been curious and eager to learn, but for a long time, I didn't quite know where I wanted to focus that energy. Now, I'm diving into the real world of tech with an open mind and a fresh perspective. This is my first real step into programming and web development, and why it can be challening, it's also incredibly rewarding. I'm especially excited to learn how to use tools like GitHub and Visual Studio Code, and I want to become confident in writing clean, organized code. Outside of tech, I love reading books on self- growth, jounraling my thougts, and exploring nature through hiking. Traveling and connecting with different cultures also inspires me. I'm hoping this journey not only teaches me technical skills but also helps me grow as a person- more focused, more creative, and more confident in what I can accomplish.
